a)
Hello Professor,
I'm CPT student and doing Database Engineer duty at University of Chicago Illinois based on my background and expericence.
I haven't background of Spring Boot Framework so far and it's totally new subject to me. I promise that I'll do my best on this course until end.
I successfully completed both task of Lab1 but little confused on SpringMVC.
1) Why the controller class syntax different between your demo lab1 code and video recording (the page at 28:05 minutes in lesson 1 part 4)
I assume that the video recorded almost 4 years ago and syntax bit changed on newer release of SpringMVC Framework. Am I correct?

b) I hereby declare that this submission is my own original work and to the best of my
knowledge it contains no materials previously published or written by another person.
I am aware that submitting solutions that are not my own work will result in an NC of
the course.
I am aware that I am not allowed to share solutions with other students.
I am aware that if I submit only parts of this lab that points will be subtracted.
I am aware that if my lab submission does not contain this readme.txt file that I do not
get points for this lab.
